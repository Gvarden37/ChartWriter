•	Keep a bank of chart objects (curves, bars, pies, legends and groups) for reuse across charts.
•	Graph subclassing. Tailor your graphs objects to make them appear in different shapes and forms
•	Axis rotation. Turn axis pairs around the clock.
•	Create correlation diagrams using double value axes support.
•	Database interaction
•	Overflow management. Choose between contraction, compression or scrolling when point objects exceeds available screen space
•	Read and write charts to files, keeping their full richness. Load data series into predefined charts.

ChartWriter offers some basic statistic functions (including linear regression and simple moving average). However, if your goal is to create advanced financial or statistic applications, you should probably consider another tool than ChartWriter.
